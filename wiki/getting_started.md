# Getting Started

There's a couple key tools and technologies our team uses.
1. GitHub
2. Python
3. Robot Operating System (ROS)

You can ask the team lead at any time for any additional clarification, this is just a resource to learn on your own, but you can always ask other team members for help!

## GitHub
GitHub is a version control platform that allows developers to store and manage code. Version control allows many people to work on the same project at once and makes it a much more seamless process. We use GitHub for our team. 

We have a few different repositiories. Repositories (aka repos) store code for different projects. For example, we have a repo for our test robot (Terrence) and a repo for our competition robot. We also have one for our exploration code as well.

### Team Standards for Git
The plan will be to only push to main in our code repos after a *code review*. Whenever you are writing code, use the following standard /feature-your-name, for example if you are working on color identification and your name is angeline, name the branch /color-identification-angeline. Also make sure to pull code from a branch before you start working! 

## Python
There are plenty of online tutorials for a variety of coding languages. We primarily use Python. 
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python-3/)

## Robot Operating System
Robot Operating System is a set of software libraries and tools that help to build robot applications. We use ROS Melodic, a version that works with Ubuntu 18.04. 
* Ubuntu is a operating system, like Windows or MacOS. In order to run Ubuntu on your computer you need to dual boot. Which isn't the simplest thing. Instead, we use the Aerospace server so you can code in ROS without dual booting! Reach out to the programming lead/server admin for details on how to get an account

In order to learn ROS there's lots of great tutorials on the [ROS Wiki](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials).

Below are a few ROS videos from our team:
1. How to install ROS [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUZZWglS6nE)
2. How pub/sub systems work [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_M7PgCj_cI)
3. ROS packages and nodes [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zum6wJvT0go)
4. An example of a ROS structure [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DWY-JECWM)

We also have a page to store commonly encountered errors in ROS, be sure to keep [it](../_posts/2023-10-25-debugging-ros.md) updated.
